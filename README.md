ðŸŒž Solar Power Monitoring System Using ThingSpeak
This project focuses on real-time monitoring of solar power generation using an IoT-based approach. It involves measuring key parameters such as voltage, current, and power generated by a solar panel setup. The data is collected using sensors and processed by a microcontroller (ESP8266), which transmits it to the ThingSpeak cloud platform for live visualization and analysis.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Measures solar panel voltage, current, and power output
Sends data to ThingSpeak for real-time monitoring and graphing
Enables remote access to energy data from anywhere via the internet
Helps analyze solar efficiency and detect performance issues
ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU)
Voltage and current sensors
Wi-Fi module
ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform
This system supports energy optimization and promotes smart solar energy usage through IoT integration.
